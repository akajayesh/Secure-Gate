1] Now okay, the scripts are ready and now we can implement the GUI. A modern GUI using module customtkinter. Change is will be like:-

1} The gui must have to render the browse option to browse which folder or file user has to lock. 
2} There must be 2 options one will be file and one will be folder. 
3} Then, the GUI placement must be in the middle of the screen. 
4} It must be similar to McAfee antivirus where I can see it perfectly in the middle of my screen. 
5} The GUI must support all the file types present in the world for encryption & decryption.
6} There must be option of maximizing the GUI and the fields where user will enter the details must not be misplaced.
7} Implement GUI by refering the 5 files named as reigster_left.py, register_right.py, new_soln.py , encrypt_jack.py and       
   decrypt_jack_simple.py (This is in case if the user hasn't placed the camera well so user can use that to decrypt)
8} Make that modern -- Make it very smooth, even it can run smoothly in an 10th gen core i3 processor. 
9} Also the gui must display first welcome then proceed for the encryption part.
10} ***You can tell me here what we can add more but it must be doable for an human***


Now remember all these 10 points and Start the process.

2] Very well done! That's a great foundation though! Now start with the implementation of first 4 features you said :-
- Add a settings page for theme switching (dark/light/system).
- Show encryption/decryption progress bars for large files/folders.
- Add a log/history panel for recent actions.
- Integrate palm registration directly into the GUI (button to launch register_left/right.py).

I have an experience of developing a web UI with you and I hope you will be the same in case of GUI also.
Start and End in this chat only.

3] You are buiding a consistency streak now! You have to do now:-

1} Go with the connecting the encryption/decryption logic in by referring pt2.py (I am doing this because I want all the logic and program and I will study each and every file and the end!).
2} You know in websites there is an option of selecting multiple files by pressing shit key and navigation keys. They help to select multiple files. Also provide a feature as when I tap on my mouse pad as move cursor here and there, it creates a blue area and selects   required files.
3} Don't misplace the old features you implemented for the new ones. You are great with consistency but remember I told you about that McAfee GUI thing. When I maximized that gui, all the fields move to the right side of screen. The field placement in file modern_gui.py are best and refer that file for field placments.
4} I told you that decrypt_simple will be for fall back! In case if user is not in correct conditions. You have implemented that logic and neverthelessly, the new_soln.py logic is not used. Look for this 

Start and End in this chat. Don't overspeed as overspeeding will cost both of us.

4] Great experience and great efforts! Now I want to tell you that:-
1} You haven't used the AES library and I can see the encrypting animation but they are not encrypted in reality. 

2} Buttons like register left/right palm are functioning well but there are alignment issues.

3} Also the process is like :-
   Welcome page with proceed button ->
   Choose the file/folder for encryption ->
   Encrypt using AES Algo ->
   Decrypt using regitered_palm (Fallback is ONLY FOR WORST CONDITONS OF ACCORDING TO OTHER USER) ->
   Setting for color (User based only) -> 
   End 

4} So hey, I am here to show my new project made with your earlier version. 
Now I want you to act as my senior developer and fix the issues occruing in the code. 

1} Very first you don't have to change the entire features for one feature. You just have to change whether its necessary.
2} Now I am facing issues with decryption after registering. Even I am unable to decrypt the file.
3} When I encrypt and then click of decrypt button, It replies to me "Please select files to decrypt" even though I have selected.
4} Also, issues are occuring recursively like if I fix one, then another old one occurs. If I do again then again something occurs.
   I want you to make sure that this point doesn't occur again.

Now the entire project is in file could_be_final.py and rest are its required scripts.

Fix all these issues and use your 100% power with proper awareness.

Problem kay aahe nakki:-
new_soln backbone aahe.
Tyat ek ek file decrypt karaychi takat aahe.
Tyat logic implement karava lagel AOC (ACCORDING to occruing conditions)

5] 

The files encrypt_jack.py, simple.py , new_sol.py and register_left & register_right are backbone of using_AES.py.
new_sol can decrypt  whole folder when it is used independently. But using_aes file, it does decryption one by one.
Is my decision of encrypting file different and folder different good? 
Because Windows has no inbuilt applock and in android the approach of applock is very similar to encrypt in folder.
I don't know about IOS for now.
You tell me whether we must remove the option of encrypting file one by one and just keep only folder encryption & decryption system?

6]
But from the current scenario, we must go with folder based only becasue I have discussed a lot of problems, fixes and issues with you and sometimes the results were fine. Sometimes results were not same. I feel we must go with folder encryption as bulk encryption will be faster (i don't know much but you can come up if I am wrong.)

Even I use to lock a whole folder using .bat file and then entering a key and it was similar to AES encryption style.

Reply in this chat only.

7] Now you have to do:-
1} The current UI is best from my side.
  Just remove the file selecting option as I wrote earlier and don't misplae the old fields.
2} Rest color combo is great -- it was my idea you just followed my instruction lol

3} I am not an orderer, we both have same contribution.

7] 
Congrats for both of us. We have solved that issue. 
Now the main problem is with decryption process using palm.
1} When I scan my palm, the app displays Unlocked message at frontend 
but in backend the story is different.
2} Why is this even occuring? new_sol.py decrypts fastly, doesn't takes time 
   but GUI is taking a lot.
3} What could be the best fix here?

4} Implement the solution without misplacing all the fields and previously implemented
   features. Humble request!
 Start and End in this chat only.

8] Hey Trae, we are moving towards the end goal.
 1} So I told you about the one by one encryption earlier.
   GUI is still asking me for one by one decryption else decrypting whole folder.

 2} Why is this ? new_sol script just decrypts straight away. 

 3} Implement fix for this issue in this chat only.

9] 
DONE!!! TEARS OF HAPPINESS! 
THIS project is going to level up my resume! Thank You so Much ChatGpt / TRAE !! 

But, Wait our core part is over now but there are some minor changes and 
I would like to implement now itself.

1} I after selecting the files to encrypt, I have to select the files again to decrypt.
This is not productive although
2} Also, when the GUI is displayed, some part of that display box is inside the screen.
  Take that slightlhy upwards so it will be better for displaying purposes.
3} I have to press control + c to close the camera after registering palm.
   Implement something for camera which will lead to close directly after
   the palms are registered (for both right and left)
4} Do all this without misplacing all the previously implemented features/
  fields/fucntions
5} Implement all this in this chat itself.

10] 
Our project is may be complete but its still not decent enough.

1} The palm recognition works well, but if the palm goes wrong then fallback also goes down.

2} Scenario is like when I encrypt the folder in my directory for another time,
 the decrypt logic doesn't works properly.

3} It doesn't works now as I tried with another folder also.
4} Implement the fixes in this chat only. 

Okay , I am here to fix my current project. I built it using your features
Now I want to make it reboust using your features

1} I want to remove that file encryption and keep only folder encryption
option. This will make sure the folder is encrypted only.
2} After selecting the folders of encryption, the selected folders must be decrypted
only. User must not browse files again for decryption.
3} There must be only batch encryption and decryption. Like after selecting full folder, 
  the folder must be decrypted not one file and one bye one. 
4} In register_files for both right and left, after the rendering of those scripts, I have to press ctrl + c 
  for stopping camera. Fix that logic also.
5} While implementing, don't misplace previous features/fields/anything.

Implement all these fixes/features in this chat only.

Everything was great as planned.
Now do the following things:-
1} I have to select the files for decryption after encrypting. I told you that 
   this decreases productivity.
   Fix this issue by keeping the encrypted folder as the folder to decrypt.
   No other selection after selecting the folder for encryption.

2} I also told you about decyrpting all files present in folder once.
  The files are decrypting once, but still the script is running and asking 
  my palm for decryption although the files are decrypted.

Fix above issues in top.py
Start and End in this chat only.

11] Great job! Our core part is ready. 
We have to improve the UI now.

1} Make font style modern. Change it to segeo ui.
2} Font increase the font size and it must be good for displaying.
3} When the GUI is displayed, the messagebox part of it inside the taskbar of my windows and I have to take up all the time. Fix that also.
4} Buttons after welcome page must be like :-
   1) First will be select folder and clear selection
   2) Then box which displays all files which are ready for encryption.
   3) Then further buttons will be :-
    a) Encrypt    b) Decrypt
    c) Reg_right  d) Reg_left
       
           e) settings
   {Please follow the following abc format for my buttons!}
5} At the bottom, there will be messagebox.

Remember Implement all these UI fixes without touching
old implemented features/fields as our core part is over
